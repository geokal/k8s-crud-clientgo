This commit implements a basic Kubernetes client application that demonstrates
the usage of client-go library to interact with a Kubernetes cluster.

Key features:
- Configure Kubernetes client using local kubeconfig
- List all pods across namespaces periodically
- Demonstrate proper error handling for pod operations
- Support custom kubeconfig path via command line flag

Technical details:
- Uses client-go for Kubernetes API interaction
- Implements periodic pod listing with 10-second intervals
- Includes comprehensive error handling for NotFound cases
- Supports both default and custom kubeconfig paths

This example serves as a reference implementation for basic
Kubernetes client operations using the official Go client library.
